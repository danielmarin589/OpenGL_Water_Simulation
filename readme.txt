For the grid, I didn't find any 3d object on the internet for some reason so I installed Blender and generated one myself. The grid has approximately 60.000 vertices.I also downloaded a water texture, which was originally jpg so I converted it to BMP and then loaded it onto the grid. I added a boat and some rocks as objects into the scene for which I created shaders individually. For the directional wave I created parameters in the main program that I send to the shader as uniforms(I created one vertex shader for each type of wave), where the formula gets computed and modifies my y for each vertex in the grid for each frame. I added another set of parameters for circular waves in the main and did the same thing I did for directional waves, the only difference being that I a have a Ci variable to compute before the formula. Afterwards, I created a new vertex shader in which I compute both formulas(directional and circular waves) and add the results. I did the same for the 3rd and 4th wave, I created two new shaders, where I played with the formulas until I got a result that I liked. I, then, added a flag variable which would help me switch from directional waves to circular waves to directional+circular waves and so on while rendering the scene. For the last task I didn't manage to fully complete it, since the lighting doesn't change at all from the starting point. I only managed to rotate and translate the sun so as to make it revolve around the scene when holding the TAB key. As a bonus, I managed to implement sound in the project! (WARNING: volume is loud!)
